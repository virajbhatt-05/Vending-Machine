# Vending-Machine
This Verilog project implements a 10-rupee vending machine using an FSM. While the FPGA simulation supports 5/10-rupee inputs and change logic, the physical hardware uses 74-series ICs to process 2-rupee increments via button presses. Includes LED indicators and 7-segment displays for real-time status.
